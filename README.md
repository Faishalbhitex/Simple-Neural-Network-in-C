# Simple Neural Network in C

This is a simple implementation of a neural network written in C, created from scratch. The project is designed for educational purposes, helping others (and myself) understand how neural networks function at a fundamental level.

## Features
- Implements basic neural network concepts, including forward propagation, backward propagation, and weight updates.
- Uses ReLU and sigmoid activation functions.
- Provides basic loss calculation (Mean Squared Error).

## Motivation
This project was developed to deepen my understanding of neural networks while exploring C programming. It is inspired by my learning process with guidance from AI assistants like ChatGPT and Claude.

## Requirements
- GCC compiler
- GNU Make (optional, for compiling with the provided Makefile)
- A terminal environment (e.g., Termux)

## Installation and Usage

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Faishalbhitex/Simple-Neural-Network-in-C.git
cd Simple-Neural-Network-in-C
